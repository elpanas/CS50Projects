## Why is my project distinct from the others?

Because the purpose of this project is different from the previous ones and Pizza Project too.

## Why is my project more complex than the others?

I used React.js to write more readable code, Django F() expressions to compare model fields and I mixed all technologies, learnt during the course, together.
